The Smart Reconciliation & Audit System is a full-stack MERN application designed to automate the process of reconciling uploaded transaction data with existing system records while maintaining complete auditability. The system allows users to upload large CSV/Excel files asynchronously, process and store records efficiently, and apply configurable reconciliation rules to identify matched, unmatched, and duplicate transactions. A dashboard provides real-time insights such as total uploads, reconciliation accuracy, and match distribution using visual charts. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, leveraging MongoDB for scalable data storage and audit logging, while the React-based frontend ensures a responsive and user-friendly experience. The application is architected to support role-based access (Admin, Analyst, Viewer), handle partial failures without disrupting processing, and maintain data consistency through upload tracking and reconciliation results, making it suitable for real-world financial and enterprise reconciliation workflows.
